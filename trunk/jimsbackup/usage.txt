Backup-map file syntax
======================

The backup-map file contains a list of backup source directories and 
destination directories separated by bars (|).  The destination 
directories are relative to the backup-root.  Source directories are
absolute paths.

example:

  C:\web|web
  C:\temp|temp
  D:\data|data
