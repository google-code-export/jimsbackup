===========

mimic usage of Microsoft utility robocopy for windows xp.

mirror
------

mimic functionality of robocopy with /mir switch enabled.

Functionality:
  Recursively walk through source and destination directories comparing files
  and directories for changes.  For files only in the source, copy them to the
  destination.  For directories only in source, recursively copy the directory
  and all files under it to the destination.  For files only in destination, 
  delete them.  For directories only in destination, delete the tree.  For files
  in both source and destination, copy source to destination if source is newer 
  (modified time of source > modified time of dest) or if the files have 
  different sizes.  This is how the MS tool works.
  
Requirements:
  1. source and dest must be provided
  2. source must be a directory path
  3. source must exist
  4. destination is assumed to be a directory even if a file exists with the 
     same name.
  5. destination does not need to exist
