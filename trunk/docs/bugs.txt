0.1c2:1
-------
When you remove a directory from the backup map, the directory (and all files
that it contains) still shows up in new backups.  

This happens because hardlinks are created by ln.exe from the past version 
before robocopy runs.

I think one solution would be to change the way hard links are created.  Instead
of doing one call to ln.exe for the whole backup directory, loop over the 
''destination directories'' in the backup map and create hardlinks only for
these directories.  I assume that ones that do not exist will fail (as 
expected), but the backup process should continue successfully.
