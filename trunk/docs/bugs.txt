This is the bug history of JimsBackup sorted by version.

jimsbackup-0.1c2
================

0.1c2:1
-------
When you remove a directory from the backup map, the directory (and all files
that it contains) still shows up in new backups.  

This happens because hardlinks are created by ln.exe from the past version 
before robocopy runs.

I think one solution would be to change the way hard links are created.  Instead
of doing one call to ln.exe for the whole backup directory, loop over the 
''destination directories'' in the backup map and create hardlinks only for
these directories.  I assume that ones that do not exist will fail (as 
expected), but the backup process should continue successfully.

jimsbackup-0.2c1
================

0.2c1:1
-------
VERSION.TXT file not included in distribution.

jimsbackup-0.3c1
================

0.3c1:1
Attachments for emails sent using sendgmail.js are corrupted if the body is not set.

jimsbackup-0.3c2
================

0.3c2:1
ln.exe doesn't work when the first backup mapping is for a folder.  The problem is that the
root backup folder (i.e. bkp-20101008091600\) would not exist yet, and ln.exe doesn't like that.

jimsbackup-0.6c1
================

0.6c1:1
If the value provided for /KEEP is greater than the number of existing backups, some false
information will be provided in the log about what will be deleted and what will be kept.

jimsbackup-0.7c1
================

0.7c1:1
Missing functions listFiles, listFolders in backup.js.
